- ISSUE: Having one person selected and neither amounts filled in, selecting other person
gives $0.00 with original person having $0.
	- Solution: Add simplify function to only display decimal when amount is less than
$1000. $999.99 is the max number to show decimal.

- Create component for properties with array values that can toggle between them by pressing
up or down arrows. 
	- Use sliding animation to move between strings in array. 

- Use image of bill stack to repeat as background image to represent certain amount of money.
Show legend specifying how much one bill stack is worth.

- Declare functions outside of component functions instead of inside.
	- As a general rule of thumb, if a function doesn't rely on this, it can probably
	 be defined outside the class. Having it be standalone makes it easier to define, 
	read, and test.

- Put each notes attribute in same container with label to ensure they line up and can add
border between each container. OR use table element.
<table>
    <caption></caption>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
	<td>{first.person.name}</td>
	<th scope="row">Name</th>
	<td>{second.person.name}</td>
	</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

- When click to select person, open box that allows you to search/sort/filter list of people
to select.
	- Filter: Sex, Age slider with two points for range, 
	  Worth slider with two points for range, Countries (multiple selected),
	- Sort: worth, age, alphabetical
	- Search: show possible matches as typing in search bar
	- Reference Santa Cruz Naturals website layout for search/sort/filter

- Display entered amount in green text with currency symbol above text input box for every
digit changed. Opposite amount changes automatically. May have to use reducer hook to change
one amount state when other amount state changes.

- ISSUE: If select two people and enter amount in one box, then change one of the people, which
amount changes? Use state lastChanged to track amount that was previously changed and keep
that the same while changing the other amount.

- Use React Redux to track state changes

- Wealth Comparison
	Compare equivalent currency of average person to top billionaires in world.
	Use average net worth of each as conversion.
	Example:
		Median Net Worth of Average US Citizen: $76,000
		Bill Gates Net Worth: $96.5 billion
		Bill Gates $3,000,000 = Average $2.36
		3000000*(76000/96500000000) = 2.36
		billionaire input / billionaire net worth = avg input / avg net worth
		avg input = billionaire input * (avg net worth / billionaire net worth)
	List charitable donations from billionaires converted to avg equivalent
	Include Ability to enter Custom Net Worth
	Include options for average citizens such as limited to certain age groups. Ex. median net worth is lower for people under 35.
	- Ex.
	"Jeff Bezos" spending "$XXX,XXX"
		is equivalent to
	"Average 30 yr old" spending "$XXX"
